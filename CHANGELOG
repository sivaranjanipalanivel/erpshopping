- During addToCart operation, we made sure to update the item base_price to keep consistent data on cart.
- Fixed issue where coupon discount would apply to a zero value's original price causing extra discounts.
- Fixes issue where coupon error message doesn't set group_name key
- Fixed bug where shipping method and address would stay on quotation when cart was loaded and UI would not reflect those values. Fix just clears these fields to allow user to reselect.
